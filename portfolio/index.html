            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I am Aman Kumar Modak, hailing from the coal capital of India, Dhanbad, Jharkhand. My educational journey began at SSVM Baghmara, a CBSE-affiliated school, where I completed my tenth grade with a commendable 73.38% score. Later, I pursued my 12th grade from DAV Public School, Sector 4, Bokaro Steel City, another CBSE-affiliated institution, securing 64%.</p>
            <p>While I may not consider myself a professional, I find joy in the intellectual challenge of playing chess. It's a game that not only sharpens the mind but also allows for strategic thinking. Beyond the chessboard, I often find solace in the world of music during my free time, appreciating the diverse melodies that resonate with my mood.</p>
            <p>At this point, I don't have a specific hobby that I can call my own, but I see that as an exciting opportunity to explore and discover new interests in the near future. Currently, I am diligently working towards a degree in Computer Science and Engineering at RIT Roorkee. My focus is on cybersecurity, as I aspire to contribute to the ever-evolving field and play a role in ensuring digital security.</p>
            <p>I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead in my academic and personal journey, and I am open to embracing new challenges and opportunities that come my way. Let's see where the future takes me! </p>
